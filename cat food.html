        <p>At our house, feeding the cat is a daily bonding exercise. Our big Siberian mix, Max, sits by his bowl and purrs loudly when he sees the can of wet cat food. He also likes snacking on a low-calorie dry cat food that’s always available to him. He’s happy—but it made us wonder, what makes for the best dry cat food?</p>
        <p>We went on a search to learn more about cat nutrition and this style of feline food.</p>
        <h2>
            What Should We Feed Our Cats?
        </h2>
        <p>With all the dry, canned, fresh, and raw foods on the market, it can be difficult to decide what to feed your cat.</p>
        <p>The first thing to know is that cats are obligate carnivores; they need an ample supply of meat. As meat-eating hunters, cats evolved with diets containing high levels of animal protein, moderate amounts of fat, and only minimal carbohydrates from vegetables and grains.</p>
        <h2>Can Dry Food Fit in Your Mix?</h2>
        <p>Many adult cats can thrive on a full or partial diet of convenient and affordable dry foods—here’s a look at the pros and cons.</p>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><bold>Convenience.</bold> Leave food out in the morning and go about your workday. While some cats are gobblers, most are content to simply graze throughout the day. You won’t come home late in the evening to an anxious, hungry cat.</li>
                <li><bold>Freshness.</bold> Dry food can be left out if your cat is at home alone for the weekend. A feeding device can ensure they access the right amount of food each day.</li>
                <li><bold>Reassurance.</bold> If your cat is a rescue or suffers from food insecurity, just knowing that a bowl with dry food is available can reduce anxiety about eating.</li>
                <li><bold>Cleaning.</bold> Dry food is less messy and less smelly.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><bold>Low moisture.</bold> Many cats get water from their food, but dry food can’t satisfy this need. Make sure your cat has access to fresh water and is actually drinking it. You can also include some wet food as part of their diet.</li>
                <li><bold>Taste.</bold> Many cats tend to prefer wet food, so dry foods are often coated in fat to make them more appealing to your kitty’s taste buds. While some cats will happily chow down on dry foods, others vastly prefer wet food and will let you know about it. If your cat is finicky, not eating well, or takes medication that must be mixed into food, you may need to include wet food in their daily meal plan.</li>
                <li><bold>Bulky bags.</bold> Dry cat foods are heavy, and many come only in large bags. They can be a pain to lug into your house. And if you try a new food and your kitty turns up his nose—well, there you are with 15 pounds of unwanted kibble.</li>
                

            </ul>

        <p>It’s likely just fine to feed your cat an all-dry food diet—but be sure to check with your vet who knows your cat and their specific health issues. (Note: Very small kittens aren’t fully able to chew kibble and get enough nutrition from it and will need at least some wet food.)</p>
        <p>If you do feed your cat dry food, make sure that it stays fresh and that your cat has access to water at all times. It’s not a bargain to buy a huge bag of dry food if you have only one cat—dry food should be consumed within two months of opening the package. Store dry food in a cool, dry location, away from sunlight to prevent spoiling, and keep the original bag (which is designed to keep food fresh) or container tightly closed.</p>
        <h2>The Best Dry Cat Foods</h2>
        <p>The dried cat foods that made our list are approved by the Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) as meeting the basic minimum nutritional requirements for cats. They contain these feline diet essentials:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>High in protein</li>
            <li>Moderate amounts of animal fats</li>
            <li>Essential vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and amino acids</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Be sure to select a food that is appropriate for your cat’s age, weight, and health status. We’ve included some dry foods for kittens (small bites and kitten-safe) as well as weight management formulas and foods for senior cats (generally lower in calories).</p>
